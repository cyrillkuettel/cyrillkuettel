<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Cyrill <img width="30px" height=30px" src="https://github.com/cyrillkuettel/cyrillkuettel/blob/main/img/Hi.gif"></h1>




I enjoy programming.
I <i>really</i> like building things.   
I have been absolutely fascinated with coding since age fourteen. Most of the things I know I learned from first-hand experience.

Ingenious invententions inspire me.
