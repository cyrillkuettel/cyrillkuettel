I enjoy programming. I <i>really</i> like building things.   
I have been absolutely fascinated with coding since age fourteen. Most of the things I know I learned from first-hand experience.

I enjoy ingenious invententions, they inspire me.

###  Other things I'm interested in
- Chess (See my [knight's tour](https://github.com/cyrillkuettel/knights-tour) implementation )
- Linux
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Reading / learning new languages
