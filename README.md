I have been absolutely fascinated with coding since age fourteen. Most of the things I know I learned from first-hand experience.
What my motivation boils down to (from an engineering perspective) is that <i>theory often follows invention.</i> Engineering, say inventing new artifacts, that's where the creative process happens. That's where we have orginality, boldness and nonconformity. I enjoy ingenious invententions, they inspire me.

###  Other things I'm interested in
- Chess
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Reading / learning new things
