I'm a software developer. I mainly write Java and Python applications. I <i>really</i> like building things.   
I have been absolutely fascinated with coding since age fourteen. Most of the things I know I learned from first-hand experience.
What my motivation boils down to (from an engineering perspective) is that <i>theory often follows invention.</i> Engineering, say inventing new artifacts, that's where the creative process happens. That's where we have orginality.   
I enjoy ingenious invententions, they inspire me.

###  Other things I'm interested in
- Chess (See my [knight's tour](https://github.com/cyrillkuettel/knights-tour) implementation )
- Linux
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Reading / learning new things
