# Hi, I'm Cyrill 👋🏾

I have been absolutely fascinated with coding since age fourteen. Most of the things I know I learned from first-hand experience.
What my motivation boils down to (from an engineering perspective) is that <i>theory often follows invention.</i> Engineering, say inventing new artifacts, that's where the creative process happens. That's where I'm most interested in: ingenious invententions and orginality.
